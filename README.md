🤖 AI Chatbot using Python & Azure AI Foundry
An intelligent cloud-powered chatbot built using Python and Azure AI Foundry.
The chatbot understands natural language queries and generates intelligent, real-time responses using Azure AI services.
🚀 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to integrate Azure AI services with Python to build a smart conversational assistant. The chatbot processes user input, sends structured prompts to Azure AI, and returns contextual responses.
The focus of this project was:
AI service integration
Prompt engineering
API handling
Real-time response generation
🛠 Tech Stack
